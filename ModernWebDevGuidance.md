# 🌐 Modern Web Development Guidance

A comprehensive guide to principles, paradigms, design patterns, architectures, and best practices for building **scalable, maintainable, and production-ready** applications.  
Useful for interviews, real-world development, and mastering modern software engineering.

## 1. Core Principles & Practices

### General Principles
- **SOLID**
  - **S**ingle Responsibility → one reason to change.
  - **O**pen/Closed → extend behavior without modifying code.
  - **L**iskov Substitution → subclasses should be interchangeable with parents.
  - **I**nterface Segregation → small, specific interfaces.
  - **D**ependency Inversion → depend on abstractions, not implementations.
- **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** → avoid duplication of logic/config.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** → prefer simple solutions over complex ones.
- **YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)** → don’t build features until necessary.
- **Separation of Concerns** → isolate business logic, presentation, data, infra.
- **Law of Demeter** → modules should have limited knowledge of others.
- **Design by Contract** → functions/classes declare pre/post-conditions.
- **Fail Fast & Defensive Programming** → detect and stop errors early.
- **Convention over Configuration** → prefer defaults (e.g., Rails, Laravel).

### Development Practices
- **TDD / BDD** → tests drive design & verify behavior.
- **CI/CD** → every commit is tested, integrated, deployable.
- **Code Review & Pair Programming** → knowledge sharing + quality control.
- **Agile/DevOps** → iterative development, automation, monitoring.
- **Documentation** → minimal but clear docs for APIs and services.

## 2. Programming Paradigms

- **Imperative** → step-by-step execution (common in scripting).
- **Declarative** → describe *what* not *how* (SQL, React JSX).
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** → encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.
- **FP (Functional Programming)** → immutability, pure functions, higher-order functions.
- **Event-Driven** → systems react to events/messages (Node.js, Kafka).
- **Reactive** → async data streams + propagation (RxJS, Reactor).
- **Concurrent/Parallel** → multi-threading, async, goroutines.
- **Aspect-Oriented (AOP)** → separate cross-cutting concerns (logging, auth).
- **Data-Oriented (DOP)** → focus on data transformations (popular in big data).

## 3. Design Patterns

### Creational
- **Singleton** → one instance (e.g., DB connection pool).
- **Factory Method** → encapsulated object creation.
- **Abstract Factory** → families of related objects.
- **Builder** → step-by-step construction (query builders).
- **Prototype** → clone pre-configured instances.

### Structural
- **Adapter** → bridge incompatible interfaces (wrap APIs).
- **Bridge** → separate abstraction from implementation.
- **Composite** → treat group of objects uniformly (tree structures).
- **Decorator** → add responsibilities dynamically (middleware).
- **Facade** → simplified interface to complex system.
- **Flyweight** → share common state efficiently.
- **Proxy** → surrogate to control access (lazy loading, auth).

### Behavioral
- **Chain of Responsibility** → pass request along chain (middleware).
- **Command** → encapsulate requests as objects (CLI commands).
- **Iterator** → sequentially access collections.
- **Mediator** → centralize communication between objects.
- **Memento** → capture/restore state (undo feature).
- **Observer (Pub/Sub)** → event listeners, message brokers.
- **State** → change behavior by state (finite state machines).
- **Strategy** → interchangeable algorithms (auth strategies).
- **Template Method** → define skeleton, let subclasses vary steps.
- **Visitor** → separate operations from objects.

### Modern Applied Patterns
- **Dependency Injection (DI)** → inject services (testable, modular).
- **Repository Pattern** → abstract persistence layer.
- **Middleware Pattern** → request/response pipeline (Express, Gin).
- **CQRS** → separate read & write models.
- **Event Sourcing** → system state = log of events.
- **Saga Pattern** → manage distributed transactions.

## 4. Architecture Patterns

- **Layered Architecture (N-tier / MVC)**  
  Presentation → Application → Domain → Infrastructure.

- **Hexagonal / Clean Architecture (Ports & Adapters)**  
  Business logic at the center, frameworks as plugins.

- **Microservices**  
  Independent deployable services, loosely coupled.

- **Event-Driven Architecture**  
  Systems communicate via events (Kafka, RabbitMQ).

- **Serverless Architecture**  
  Function-based compute, managed by cloud (AWS Lambda).

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**  
  Organize code around business domains (Ubiquitous Language).

- **Monolith-first**  
  Start simple, extract services when scaling requires.

## 5. Systems & Scalability Principles

- **12-Factor App** → config in env vars, treat logs as streams, disposability.
- **CAP Theorem** → Consistency vs Availability vs Partition tolerance.
- **ACID vs BASE** → strong transactions vs eventual consistency.
- **Idempotency** → safe retries in distributed systems.
- **Caching**  
  - Strategies: write-through, read-through, lazy loading.  
  - Tools: Redis, Memcached.
- **Sharding & Partitioning** → split data for horizontal scaling.
- **Load Balancing** → distribute requests across servers.
- **Resilience Patterns**  
  - Circuit Breaker → stop cascading failures.  
  - Retry with backoff → handle transient errors.  
- **Observability**  
  - Logging → structured logs.  
  - Metrics → system health (Prometheus).  
  - Tracing → request flows (Jaeger, OpenTelemetry).
